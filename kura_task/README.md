# Kura coding task

Implement a 3D live streaming application in Unity which connects 2 people across 2 machines.

### Application Criteria:
- Connect yourself and a member of the Kura team using a webcam.
- Both individuals must be in the same environment.
- Both individuals must be able to talk with one another.
- The environment and UI should be in the theme of Cyberpunk (think futuristic, high contracts, a bit Las Vegas casino style, etc.). 
- The environment should contain AT LEAST 4 items of room decor. Such as, chairs, tables, lights, or any other interesting futurist items.

This task has three fundamental parts:
- Integration of streaming with the Unity application
- The environment/scene building
- User interface that allows the user to interact with and control the environment.
		Possible controls include: Zoom in/out, volume up/down, mute, disconnect, ect
Bonus: Feel free to get creative and add music, sounds effects, particles, ect, to the 3D scene. 

Please send us your Github username and we will start a private Git repo for you to upload your code when you finish. Make sure you include basic compile instruction in the program. 

We will be assessing your code based on:
- Basic architecture, programming level and skills.
- Code comments, structure.
- The quality and design of the Unity 3D environment.
- The functionality of your application, live streaming, user interface.
- The design and implementation of your input and control panels.
- Additional points could be gained through sound effect, interaction design and implementations.
