# Collatz

The central premise of this small project is the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). Very simply, the theory is this: 

Start with any positive integer *n*:
- If *n* is even divide it by two. 
- If *n* is odd multiply it by 3 and add 1

Continue this process forever...

Ok not forever. the Collatz **conjecture** states that any positive integer will eventually lead to the number 1 if the above two rules are followed.

## Goal of this project
Ok so I'm not going to be able to prove the conjecture. Smarter people than me have tried and failed. In this project, I'll be making pretty pictures resulting from the collatz conjecture.
